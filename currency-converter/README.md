Important! - I am not the initiator of this project. It is made as a part of the React course. With permission of the author, I use it only as an adition to my portfolio.

This is just a simple project made as a chalenge part of the course.
Simple currency converter. I think you will know how it works.

In order to run this app just type in console following commands:
1. "npm install or npm i" (same meaning) (since node_modules are added to gitignore)
2. 'npm start'

Project includes:
-fetching API from https://www.frankfurter.app/
-Using useState and useEffect

I didn't do any errors handlers here since the basic part of this chalenge was just creating simple value converter.

In future i am going to improve this converter adding new currencies and also styling some to make better impression. This will be added in different repo
